## PROBLEM SECTION

**Heading:**
You're Losing Money Every Time You Say "I'll Email That Estimate Tomorrow"

Here's what's actually happening:

You spend 30-45 minutes on-site, take notes and photos, then head back to the truck. Later—or worse, the next day—you're at your desk typing up the estimate. Material counts. Labor hours. Line items. Pricing everything from your price book.

Two hours gone. And the customer? Already talking to three other contractors.

**By the time you hit send, someone faster got the job.**

The real cost isn't the hours you're wasting. It's the jobs you're not closing because you're too slow. Same-day approvals are the new standard. If you're not delivering estimates on-site, you're falling behind.

## HOW IT WORKS SECTION

**Heading:**
Four Steps. Five Minutes. One Accurate Estimate.

**Step 1: Walk the Property**
Move through the job site room by room. The app records everything—voice notes, photos, videos. Talk naturally. No forms.

**Step 2: AI Captures Requirements**
While you talk, the AI documents customer requirements for each room. Materials needed. Scope of work. Special requests. Everything you'd normally scribble down.

**Step 3: Automatic Pricing from Your Price Book**
The AI pulls correct materials and quantities from your price book. Separates materials and labor, applies your pricing, and builds the estimate automatically.

**Step 4: Deliver Before You Leave**
Review the estimate on your phone. Make quick adjustments. Send it to the customer within minutes of finishing. While you're still in their driveway.

## FAQ SECTION

**Does it work with my existing price book?**
Yes. The AI uses your price book to pull materials, quantities, and pricing. Your numbers, your margins, your way.

**What if it gets something wrong?**
You review the estimate before sending. Make adjustments right on your phone. Takes seconds to fix a line item—still faster than typing from scratch.

**Do I need to be tech-savvy?**
If you can record a voice memo, you can use this. Walk the job, talk about what you see, done. Simpler than the apps you're using now.

**What types of trade work does it support?**
HVAC, electrical, plumbing, and other trade contractor work. The AI understands trade-specific terminology and requirements.

**How long until I get the estimate?**
Most contractors deliver estimates within 5 minutes of finishing their walkthrough. Review, adjust if needed, and send while you're still on-site.
